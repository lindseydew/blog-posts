A lot of people ask me how I got 'into tech', and I never quite know how to respond. Partly because I expect the inquisitor is anticipating to reel off a list of qualifications and experiences I had before I started working as a web developer. But the answer is much simpler. I just applied for a trainee role in the field. It's true that of tech companies hire for transferable analytic skills and aptitude, rather than specific language skills, but most people I speak to seem to be surprised to hear I could learn to programme on the job.

It was a steep learning curve at the beginning, but after a while it started to fall into place and stopped feeling like a complete mystery.

Here are the things that helped me overcome the learning hurdles:

*Programming courses:* there are so many free online courses from beginner to more advanced computer science. Doing a couple of these helped me get a bit of practice programming, and gain more of an understanding of some of the core concepts in computer science. Coursera helped me get the basics of Java and Scala.

*Work side project:* I took on a work side project to help me learn get more confident with coding. This worked really well for me because the criteria was really well defined, the structure of the code had already been written by an experienced developer, and there were people in the business that really wanted the work done. Doing it outside of work meant I could take it at my own pace, and come back to the challenging bits later. Having a good working knowledge of an entire smaller application helped me to understand the larger apps we work with day-to-day.

*Working in a work stream:* It was challenging being placed in a team with no specific programming language skill or experience of doing any work like it before. It meant having to shadow team members and ask lots of questions whilst trying not to distract them from their work too much. With no 'niche' or expertise, though, it gave me the opportunity to work on all aspects of the project and consequently I have an understanding of the full technology stack now. Having worked outside of my comfort zone for many months has made me less afraid to pick up work on tasks where I am unfamiliar with the language/technologies. Probably the best 'programming' skill I have learned is how to go about completing a task that I don't already know how to do.

*Asking people:* I have asked for help a lot, and received it. It can be a hard balance to strike in programming. Working things out for yourself can be help you get a better understanding and skills for tackling the challenge the next time, but equally talking a problem through with someone more experienced can throw new light onto a problem and help you to have better insight.

*Time:* The best way to learn a skill is to absorb yourself in it, and practice it. Often I have felt I'm not getting very far with it, but I am often surprised that every few weeks or so to suddenly find clarity in work I had found so opaque. I have learned heaps by simply going to work each day, discussing things with people, and completing my dev cards.

There are things I tried to do to improve with programming skills with less success:

Doing something for the sake of learning: There are so many things I'd like to be better at with computing. I still have a fairly long tech skills wish-list. Often I've tried to approach this by setting aside an hour or so, and telling myself to learn 'this thing'. It never works. Where do you start? How do you remember the commands? I glance through the docs and it always feels so arbitrary. It's so much better to have a thing you want to solve/achieve that utilise those particular skills. (Finding these pet projects is a different challenge...!)

It's been several more months since I started to learn to code, and I'm still learning. But I'm often surprised to realise I have skills that I can share with other programmers now too. I'm no expert, but I'm not a noob anymore either.

I think more should be done to communicate that the learning barriers for programming are not insurmountable with just a bit of time, determination and the right level of support.
